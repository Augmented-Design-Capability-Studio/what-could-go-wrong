<h1>What Could Go Wrong?</h1>
<h2>Exploring the Downsides of Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

<p>
While autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve our daily lives, there are also challenges and potential downsidesto these systems. 
In this workshop, we intend to foster discussions about the potential negative aspects of autonomous cars inhopes of surfacing challenges that should 
be considered during the design process rather than after deployment. We will spur theseconversations through a review of participant position statements
and through group discussion facilitated by a card game called“What Could Go Wrong?” Our goal is to consider the autonomous vehicle’s benefits—improving 
safety, increasing mobility, reducingemissions—against potential drawbacks. By identifying potential harms and downsides, the workshop attendees, and the 
AutoUIcommunity more broadly can design well-considered solutions.
